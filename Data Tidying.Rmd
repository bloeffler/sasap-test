```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

Read in catch data from [Mike Byerly. Alaska commercial salmon catches by management region (1886- 1997). Gulf of Alaska Data Portal. df35b.304.2.](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1)

```{r}
catch_df <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(catch_df)
```

`select` (looks like code but doesn't run as code) the columns needed for analysis

```{r}
catch_clean <- catch_df %>%
  select(-All, -notesRegCode)
head(catch_clean)
```

Change from wide to long format using `gather`

```{r}
catch_long <- gather(catch_clean, key = "species", value = "catch", -Region, -Year)
head(catch_long)
```


```{r}
regional_catch <- gather(catch_long, key = "Year", value = "catch") %>% 
  spread(catch_long, key = "Region", value = "catch")
head(regional_catch)
```

note: rename function renatme (catch_thousands = catch)

```{r}


```
